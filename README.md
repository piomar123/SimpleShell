# SimpleShell
SimpleShell, or ssl, is an easy to use and extremely effective command line for unix based systems. Unlike command lines
such as bash, SimpleShell uses explicit laungage instead of symbols in the command line to make it easier to
use. It's currently a work in progress, though you are more than welcome to download and compile the current
source code and try it out. However, the functionality is currently very limited.

# Installation
Simply download or clone the repository and compile the file named `main.c` to an exe program. 
For example type: `gcc main.c -o ssl`.

# Usage
ssl can be executed from the bash shell or can be set as a user's default shell. Currently the shell
does have somewhat limited functionality but can be used to execute all day to day shell tasks, such as
executing other shell programs and commands. To see the built-in ssl commands in ssl enter `help` into
the command line. These are the commands that ssl executes itself, to achieve other tasks the programs
will have the same names as in bash. For example `ls` will list the contents of the current directory,
you can still use `nano` to edit a file.
